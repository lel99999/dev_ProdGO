# dev_ProdGO
Production Ready GO - Development Workspace

##### Install and Check Version
- MacOS
  ```
  $brew install go/golang
  $go version
  
  $mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
  ```
  Set up Environment/GO Paths
  ```
  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
  export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
  ```

- Ubuntu (go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz = 123MB):
  ```
  $curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  $sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  $sudo chown -R root:root ./go
  $sudo mv go /usr/local
  ```
  Set up Environment/GO Paths
  ```
  $vi ~/.profile
  
  ADD the following: 
  *** GOROOT is location where Go package is installed on your system while GOPATH is location of working directory ***

  export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
  export GOPATH=$HOME/go_projects
  export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
  ```

##### Run Go
```
$go run main.go
```

##### Turn Go Code into a binary executable
```
$go build main.go
$./main
```
##### In order to run go install successfully, you must pass it the install path of the binary you created with go build. To find the binaryâ€™s install path, run the following go list command: 
```
$go list -f '{{.Target}}'
```

##### Add GoLang Linters
- [https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) <br/>
  - MacOS 
  ```
  $brew install golangci-lint
  $brew upgrade golangci-lint
  ```

  - Linux
  ```
  $curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.43.0
  $golangci-lint --version
  ```

- To Run default set of linters:
  ```
  $golanci-lint run
  ```

- Go vet is a tool concerned with code correctness
  - Use:
  ```
  $go vetn main.go
  ```
  
##### Add Go Debugger
- Add go-devel
  [https://github.com/go-delve/delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) <br/>

##### Hexagonal Architecture (introduced 2015)
- Original Intent:
  `Allow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.` <br/>

- 3 Principles of Hexagonal Architecture:
  - Explicitly separate User-Side, Business Logic, and Server-Side
  - Dependencies are going from User-Side and Server-Side to the Business Logic
  - We isolate the boundaries by using Ports and Adapters
